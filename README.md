# X Clone (Twitter UI Clone) - Tailwind CSS Project

This is a clone of the X (formerly Twitter) web interface, built entirely using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**. The project is focused on replicating the layout and design elements of X to improve my skills in responsive UI design and Tailwind utility classes.
